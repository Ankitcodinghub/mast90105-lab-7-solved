1 Lab

Introduction

Data: In this lab we will analyse Tasmanian Rainfall data which are observations representing the maximum daily rainfall in each year from 1995 to 2014 recorded by 34 weather stations in Tasmania. Data source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology (http://www.bom.gov.au/)

Goals: (i) Explore data numerically and graphically; (ii) Remind you of probability, density calculations and random number generation.

Task 1 ‚Äî Exploratory data analysis

You can import the data with the command: tasmania=read.csv(‚ÄúEditedRainfall.csv‚Äù)

There is a copy of this file ‚ÄùEditedRainfall.csv‚Äù on the LMS in the Workshop/Labs area, so you can work on this at home if you transfer the file to your computer and select a folder with this file as a working directory.

You can view the data and create variables with the following commands:

View(tasmania) dim(tasmania) # check data dimension names(tasmania[, 1:5]) # names of the first 5 columns year = tasmania[, 1] # create a vector for year s1 = tasmania[, 2] # create a vector for station 1 (Burnie) s2 = tasmania[, 3] # create a vector for station 2 (Cape Grim)

Explore the distribution of extreme rainfall in Burnie and Cape Grim by computing some basic summary statistics:

summary(s1) # 5-number summary plus sample mean sd(s1)

IQR(s1) # IQR and sample standard deviaion

# sample percentiles using Type 6 and 7

# approximations quantile(s1, type = 6) quantile(s1, type = 7) summary(s2) sd(s2, na.rm = TRUE) IQR(s2, na.rm = TRUE)

The sample mean and median suggest that the location for the distribution s1 is larger than that of s2. One observation is missing for s2 (corresponding to year 2014). Note that we need to use the option na.rm = TRUE to remove NAs. Measures of spread are obtained by computing the sample interquartile range (IQR) and sample standard deviation. The variability in s2 is slightly smaller than that of s1.

Next, explore the data by graphical summaries. The following gives an annotated density histogram for s1 and a smooth density estimate:

hist(s1, freq = FALSE, xlab = ‚ÄúExtreme rainfall (Burnie, Tas)‚Äù) smooth.density = density(s1) # fits a smooth curve

points(smooth.density, type = ‚Äúl‚Äù, lty = 2, col = 2) # adds a smooth curve

By adding the argument nclass in hist you can control the number of bins for the histogram (e.g. try to add the argument nclass=15 or breaks=15). Note that this is indicative ‚Äì R will choose a nearby number which makes a pretty histogram. From the above plot it is clear that that the sample distribution for s1 is not symmetric.

We can compare the main features of two or more distributions by multiple boxplots on the same plotting window:

boxplot(s1, s2, names = c(‚ÄúBurnie Is‚Äù, ‚ÄúCape Grim‚Äù), col = c(‚Äúyellow‚Äù, ‚Äúorange‚Äù))

The following commandsplots empirical cdfs:

ecdf1 = ecdf(s1) ecdf2 = ecdf(s2) plot(ecdf1)

plot(ecdf2, col = 2, add = TRUE)

The QQ plot compares the empirical distribution of the data against some theoretical distribution. The following compares the sample distribution with the theoretical normal distribution:

qqnorm(s1, main = ‚ÄúNormal QQ plot for S1‚Äù) qqline(s1) # normal QQ plot

Although the central part of the data distribution is compatible with the normal distribution, note that the right tail deviates from the straight line. Probability theory suggests that extremes such as rainfall maxima follow the so-called Extreme Value distribution with inverse cdf ¬µ + œÉF‚àí1(p), where F‚àí1(p) = ‚àílog(‚àílog(p)) is the inverse cdf of the standard EV distribution.

Finv = function(p) {

-log(-log(p))

} # quantile function p = (1:20)/21

y = sort(s1) # order statistics x = Finv(p) # theoretical quantiles plot(x, y, ylab = ‚ÄúSample quantiles‚Äù, xlab = ‚ÄúEV quantiles‚Äù)

# the next command computes and plots the ‚Äòbest # fitting line‚Äô (more details in next weeks) fit = lm(y ~ x)

abline(fit)

From the last QQ plot the EV model seems to be more appropriate than the normal model, since the points in EV QQ plot are a little closer to the straight line compared to the previous normal QQ plot. As an exercise, repeat the same analysis for other weather stations.

Task 2 ‚Äî Distributions and random numbers

We look at some of the basic operations associated with probability distributions. There are a large number of probability distributions available, but we only look at a few. If you would like to know what distributions are available you can do a search using the command help.search(‚Äúdistribution‚Äù).

Here we give details about the commands associated with the normal distribution and briefly mention the commands for other distributions. The functions for different distributions are very similar where the differences are noted below. To get a full list of the distributions available in R you can use the following command:

&gt;help(Distributions)

For every distribution there are four commands. The commands for each distribution are determined by a prefix indicating the functionality: d- returns the height of the probability density function (or probability mass function for discrete data), p- returns the cumulative density function q- returns the inverse cumulative density function (quantiles), and rreturns randomly generated numbers.

For simplicity, in the rest of the task we will examine the familiar normal distribution, but similar calculations can be applied to other distributions.

Given a set of values dnorm returns the height of the probability distribution at each point. If you only give the points it assumes you want to use a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. There are options to use different values for the mean and standard deviation; try the following:

dnorm(0)

dnorm(0) * sqrt(2 * pi) dnorm(0, mean = 4, sd = 2) dnorm(c(-1, 0, 1)) x = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.1) y = dnorm(x) plot(x, y, typ = ‚Äúl‚Äù)

y = dnorm(x, mean = 2.5, sd = 0.5) plot(x, y, typ = ‚Äúl‚Äù)

The second function we examine is pnorm. Given a number or a list it computes the probability that a normally distributed random number will be less than that number (i.e. it returns the normal cdf). It accepts the same options as dnorm:

pnorm(0) # Lower tail probability (cdf) pnorm(1) # pnorm(1, lower.tail = FALSE) # upper tail probability pnorm(0, mean = 2, sd = 3) x = seq(-12, 12, by = 0.1) y = pnorm(x) plot(x, y, typ = ‚Äúl‚Äù) y = pnorm(x, mean = 3, sd = 4) plot(x, y, typ = ‚Äúl‚Äù)

The next function we look at is qnorm which is the inverse of pnorm. The idea behind qnorm is that you give it a probability, and it returns the number whose cumulative distribution matches the probability. For example, try

qnorm(c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), mean = 1, sd = 2) # quartiles for N(1,2)

x = seq(0, 1, by = 0.05)

y = qnorm(x) plot(x, y) y = qnorm(x, mean = 3, sd = 2)

plot(x, y) y = qnorm(x, plot(x, y) mean = 3, sd = 0.1)

The last function we examine is the rnorm function which can generate random numbers whose distribution is normal. The argument that you give it is the number of random numbers that you want, and it has optional arguments to specify the mean and standard deviation:

rnorm(4) rnorm(4, mean = 3, sd = 3) rnorm(4, mean = 3, sd = 3) y = rnorm(200) hist(y) y = rnorm(200, mean = -2) hist(y) qqnorm(y) qqline(y)
